Python WVA Library Documentation
================================

The Python WVA Library (wvalib) provides a Python library for working
with the `Digi WVA (Wireless Vehicle Adapter) <http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-vehicle-bus-adapter/>`_
product.  The WVA exposes a rich web services interface over Wi-Fi as
well as a mechanism for streaming data.  Full documentation on the WVA
and its interfaces can be found via the `links on the product page
<http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-vehicle-bus-adapter/wireless-vehicle-bus-adapter#docs>`_.

In addition to the Python library, the package also includes a 'wva' CLI tool
that is useful for any developer using the WVA in order to explore the
web services API and debug issues.
